# open-ta: blazingly fast technical analysis indicators based on Polars

> To fix the world, we needed to do two things. One, to solve the general problem of “how to connect any code to any 
> code, anywhere”. Two, to wrap that up in the simplest possible building blocks that people could understand and use 
> easily.
>  
> It sounds ridiculously simple. And maybe it is. That’s kind of the whole point.

`open-ta` is a collection of technical analysis indicators built on [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars). They 
are all designed to be consistent and efficient. Over time you will find yourself building muscle memory using it and 
will no longer need to constantly access the documentation.

## Technical Indicators By Category

### Candles

### Cycles

### Momentum

### Overlap

### Performance

### Statistics

### Trend

### Utility

### Volatility

### Volume

## Installation

   ```sh
   pip install open-ta
   ```

## Dependencies

`open-ta` will always try to reduce dependencies to the extreme minimum. The current dependencies are specified in the
`requirements.txt` file:

- **Polars**: Blazingly fast DataFrames in Rust, Python, Node.js, R, and SQL

Ensure you have the latest versions of these dependencies installed.

## Acknowledgments

To my family, for always supporting me.  
To my girlfriend, for also putting up with me.  
To my friends, for lightening my load during the heaviest moments.  
To the open-source community, for teaching me without asking for anything in return.  
E a Patato, che mi manca in ogni istante.
