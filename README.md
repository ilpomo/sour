# sour: blazingly fast technical analysis indicators based on Polars

> To fix the world, we needed to do two things. One, to solve the general problem of “how to connect any code to any 
> code, anywhere”. Two, to wrap that up in the simplest possible building blocks that people could understand and use 
> easily.
>  
> It sounds ridiculously simple. And maybe it is. That’s kind of the whole point.

Sour is a collection of technical analysis indicators built on [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars). They are all
designed to be simple, consistent and efficient. Over time, you will end up building muscle memory using it without 
needing to constantly check the documentations.
